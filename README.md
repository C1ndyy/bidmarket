# bidmarket
**Internet community auction house.**

The purpose of bidmarket is to buy and sell personal items by auction, over the internet.  Bid in real time bidding rooms, against other prospective buyers.  Sell your painting.  Sell your chair.  Sell your shoes.  Sell your collections.  Selling = more $$$.  Enough said.  Need something, but everyone is overcharging for it?  Buy it for what its really worth by auction with bidmarket.

This project was developed for educational purposes, and is a protype.  This app allows the user to create, edit and delete listings(items), add photos to listings, and also search for listings posted and view them.  Upon viewing them the user is brought to a room with other users also bidding on an item.  A user can then place bids on the listing, updating the room dynamically.  A user can also message another user, for the purposes of enquiring about a listing.
